# Hash-Program
BU MET CS341 Final #1

Given hashprog1a.cpp, which is attached below, we need to allow the user to enter at run time the value of the number MAX so that the user has control over the number of elements in the tuple of the arrays Name, Array, and Occupied.  All three of these arrays must have the same number of members.  Once the user has entered the number MAX, you will allocate the same number of elements for each of the three arrays.  This allocation will be done dynamically at runtime three times using the new operator to provide the number of elements in each array.
